This program mainly implements the SRV_TSL algorithm which was described in our paper:

Aadaptive Reference Vectors Strategies for Many-Objective Optimization


**************************************************************************************************************************************

The code was written in matlab and based on the PlatEMO. PlatEMO is an open source and 
free MATLAB-based platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. 
Users should dowmnload the PlatEMO at http://bimk.ahu.edu.cn/index.php?s=/Index/Software/index.html.
Then copy the SRV_TSL folder to the PlatEMO\Algorithms\.Users can run PlatEMO by invoking the main()function.
Then the test module can be seen on the GUI. Users only needs to select the SRV_TSL algorithm, 
MOP and operator from the dorp-dowm list,input the corresonding parameters value in the text boxs.
Press the run button to execute the algorithm.The real-time population will be displayed in the axis.
